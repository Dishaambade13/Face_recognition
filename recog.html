            <b>How Does Facial Recognition Technology Work?</b>
            <p>
            Recognizing faces may seem a natural and easy-going process but creating the facial 
            recognition technology from scratch is challenging. It is quite difficult to develop an 
            algorithm which works well with varying conditions like large datasets, low illumination, 
            pose variations, occlusion, varying poses, etc. Despite challenges during technology
           implementation, facial recognition technology is continuously increasing due to its non-invasive 
            and contactless features.
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li><b>Face Detection</b></li>
               The process starts with human eyes, which is one of the most accessible features to detect, and then it proceeds
               to detect eyebrows, nose, mouth, etc. by calculating the width of the nose, distance between the eyes, and the shape 
               & size of mouth. Once it finds the facial region, multiple algorithm training is performed on large datasets to improve 
               the algorithm's accuracy to detect the faces and their positions.This is done by using deep neural network & machine
               learning algorithms on a large database of images with human faces looking at different angles or positions.
               <li><b>Feature Extraction</b></li>
               Once the face is detected, the software is trained with the help of computer vision algorithms to detect the facial 
               landmarks (eyebrow corners, eyes gap, tip of the nose, mouth corners, etc.) Each landmark is considered as nodal points,
               and each face has approximately 80 nodal points. These landmarks are the key to distinguish each face present in the database.

               After this, the registered face in the database is adjusted in position, size and scale to match with user's face. 
               It would help whenever the user's face moves or expression changes; the software will accurately recognize it.
               <li><b> Face Representation</b></li>
               When the facial feature is extracted, and landmarks, face position, orientation & all key elements are fed into the software,
               the software generates a unique feature vector for each face in the numeric form. These numeric codes are also called Faceprint,
               similar to Fingerprint in contact biometric system. Each code uniquely identifies the person among all the others in the 
               training dataset. The feature vector is then used to search through the entire database of enrolled users during the face
               detection process.
               <li><b>Face Matching</b></li>
               After generating the unique vector code, it is compared against the faces in the database. The database has all the information
               of registered users. If the software identifies the match for exact feature in the database, it provides all the person's
               details. If the compared featured vector value is below a certain threshold value, the feature-based classifier returns
               the id of the match found in the database.<br><br><BR>
